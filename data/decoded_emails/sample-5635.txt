Greetings,

I am Mr Yassine Hamdan an administrative financial officer/accountant at  Sonatrach S.P.A  The Algerian government Oil/Gas management company.

I have a deal for you that will pay us handsomely. I am entrusting this transaction under your custody with strong faith that you will not disappoint me. There is this excess import/export duty refund payments valued at over Two Hundred Millions United States Dollars which my department was mandated to process and pay to some indigenous and foreign Clients and companies because of over invoicing over a period of Eight months.

Most of the foreign companies are not aware of these refunds. My colleague and I plan to include your name as one of the foreign recipients that are to be paid. Out of the Two Hundred Million United States Dollars, we propose you receive the sum of Fifty Million United States Dollars USD 50M on our behalf. The money will be added into our payment channels in your favour. You will have 30% of the $US50 Million Dollars upon successful conclusion of the deal. Kindly get back to me via this email and indicate your interest in standing in for us in this deal.

Thanks,

Mr. Yassine Hamdan

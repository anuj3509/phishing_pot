Greetings Beloved Friend.
 
I'm sorry to interrupt your daily activities, I'm sending this message, please take a moment to read my email as it requires immediate and helpful response. I am Mrs. SARAH JAWAD from the Kingdom of Bahrain, a widow to the late Engr. Ahmed Jawad. l am 69 years old, suffering from long term cancer of the breast, from all indications my condition is really deteriorating and it is quite obvious that I might not live more than Six (6) months, according to my doctor because the cancer has gotten to a very worst / dangerous stage.
 
My late husband and my only child died last five years ago, his death was politically motivated. My late husband was a very Rich and Wealthy Businessman, who was running his Crude Oil and Natural Gas Company. After his death, I inherited all his business and wealth. My doctors have advised me that I may not live for more than Six (6) months. As a “Philanthropist” I have made the decision to donate a portion of my money through you, to help the Less Privileged, Orphanage homes, Students and healthcare in your country. 

During my urgent internet search, I found your email address. I prayed over it, and the spirit of our Lord Jesus pointed me to your direction as a trustworthy individual who may help me accomplish my goal in this world. Since I will never be able to keep this money, I have chosen to give you the sum of $25,500,000.00 USD (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US dollars), so that you will use the money to help the Less Privileged, Orphanage homes, Students and healthcare in your country. You should be aware that this money is in one of my husband's foreign accounts in CANADA.
 
Upon receiving your response, I will provide you with all the proof Documents and details you need to get in touch with the Bank in Canada, so that the bank will transfer the money to your bank account. When the bank sends the money to you, I sincerely hope that you would use them for the intended purpose. May God's love, the communion of God, and the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you and your family.
 
Kindly Send the below details to my private email: (  mrssarahjawad@gmail.com ) to enable us to proceed.
 
1. Your Full Names:
2. Your Full Address:
3. Your Phone Number:
4. Your Occupation:
 
God Bless you as I look forward to your positive response.
 
Mrs. Sarah Jawad.

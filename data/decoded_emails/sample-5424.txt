ATTN Beneficiary,





I hope this email meets you in good state of mind. Quite frankly, after a serious thought, I have decided to personally reach you directly because I do not have anything against you, but your so called representatives working with you to realize the remittance of your payment. However, have you ever wondered why you have been going this vicious circle over the past years with respect to having your fund paid to you without any success. It is possible that you were informed that your payment was brought to me for finalization, neither were you informed that I am the person frustrating every move to get your fund remitted to your local bank account in your country, I can assure you that this yet another deceit on the part of your representative(s).





Well, like I said earlier to you, I have nothing against you or your payment but Iâ€™m only trying to protect my interest also. I do not want to mention names here, but am certain you are aware of whom I am referring to having not received your funds.





I am the Finance/Remittance Department Director, International Wire Transfer/Telex Department, International Monetary Fund (IMF) your funds conveyor. Sometime in the past a representative of yours approached me through a friend of mine who works with one of the Government Ministries here and requested that I assist him conclude a money transfer deal having you as the beneficiary and we all agreed. According to him, he wanted to use this strategy to transfer a huge amount of US Dollars by presenting your name as Beneficiary Whose fund has not been paid.





Although we agreed that once i do that, he would give me 20% of the total fund and he will equally give me your contact information before I release the fund to your account. When he saw that I have programmed your fund for onward transfer and your name has been approved among the list of those to be paid as instead of him letting me have your contact information to enable me regulate the transfer of funds and confirm when it arrive in your account to enable me send to you my private account details for my share of the 20% as was agreed previously, what he did was to start avoiding me and which thereafter, resorted to threats, because of that, I immediately deleted your payment initializing code (PIC) from the list of those to be paid, and this made it very IMPOSSIBLE for the transfer to be completed to your account.





However, your local representative became very angry when he discoverer i was able to truncate his illicit and deceitful plots and it could not work out as he wrongly wished. What he did was to start looking for other means of trying to bribe other junior officers along with some other financial agencies to see how they could assist him secure approval to enable them transfer the money to you but all their efforts was to no avail. Is it not so funny my friend you as a beneficiary is being asked to pay several statutory fees over and over without your fund being transferred to you as well expected. Well, your fund is right here with us and am 100% responsible for the delay and obstructions of completing the transfer of funds to your account because of the breach of the gentleman agreement between me and your representative. If you doubt what I have just told you now, then go ahead and pay any amount he may oblige you pay and thereafter, he will subject you into another form of tax payment and it goes on and o





(I). You must keep my information to you in this correspondence highly secret because i don't want to get involve with him, I will have 10% of the money if successfully transfers to your local bank account because it is only the two of us in connection to logical remittance of fund to you.





(ii). You MUST assure me you will not betray me at the end of a successfully transfer of funds to your Local Bank Account and my own share will be safe until when i direct you to lodged my part of fund into an account that i will forward to you.





(iii) As you have seen, it will be useless and mere waste of money if you continue with your local representative and i can assure you that with trust and confidence we will conclude the transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality if you wish to adhere to my directives and instructions. If these conditions are acceptable to you, contact me as soon as possible to let us finalize all the arrangement and conclude the remittance of the fund to you immediately without any other delay attached.





I will give you more important details once I hear from you based on if you promise to keep away from your local representative and handle this matter with utmost confidentiality because I want to transfer the money without the knowledge of any other official of the bank or even without the knowledge of your local representative.





May the peace of our Jesus Christ be upon you.





Faithfully Yours in Him.

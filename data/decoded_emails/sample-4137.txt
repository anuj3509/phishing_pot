From: Mrs.Wathiqa Elfadil.
Darfur Sudan.



Good-Day! My name is Mrs.Wathiqa Elfadil from the Republic of Sudan, I
know this will be a surprise to you. I got your contact through a
search online from Sudanese Information Exchange (SIE) I am the wife
of Mr. Bushra Khalifah Elfadil from Darfur, Sudan. My husband was the
owner of Bushra Sea Food Industry & Bushra Farm Land in Darfur Region.
When the Government discovered that Darfur region is rich in Oil and
Mineral Resources, and the Organization Rebel Movement stepped into
Darfur to occupy those areas oil was discovered and those areas
happened to be my husband's landed properties.

The Government and the Rebels started fighting over who will inherit
the Darfur Region because of the Oil discovered. It was unfortunate
that my husband was killed in the process by the Rebels in order to
inherit the land and all my husband's companies were burnt down.
Before then my husband had moved (US$35M) Thirty-Five Million United
States America Dollars to South Africa for the establishment of
another branch of his companies. The fund was deposited in a private
security & finance company in the name of my elder son Mr. Ibrahim
Hussein Elfadil as the beneficiary. Upon his return from South Africa,
he was murdered in cold blood by the Rebel Movement.



Now, the Rebel Movement turned against the remaining family member of
my husband and I ordered my son to leave immediately for South Africa
to meet with my family Attorney who assisted my (late) husband when
the funds were deposited and he left without any delay for
Johannesburg, South Africa, I am currently in Darfur Sudan because I
am old and cannot go anywhere. Would you be interested to assist my
son in moving this money out from South Africa since his status as
asylum seeker (Refugee) does not allow the transfer of the funds in
his name, the family will offer you 35% of the total amount, 5% will
be mapped out to balance any expenses incurred, while 60% will be for
my family and will be invested in your country under your management.
This is very urgent especially now Sudan is divided and the war in
Sudan will not anytime soon.



I want you to help me retrieve this money for onward transfer to any
designated bank account of your choice for investment purposes on
these areas below:



(1) Transport Industry

(2) Mechanized Agriculture.

(3) Real Estate Investment.

(4) Any Profitable Business of Your Choice



Due to my ill-health and age, I would suggest you to please contact my
son in Johannesburg, South Africa on the stated Email Address:
ibrahimelfadil274@gmail.com   for details and procedure.

Please Contact My Son:

Mr. Ibrahim Hussein Elfadil
Email: ibrahimelfadil274@gmail.com

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation in advance.

Sincerely yours,
Mrs.Wathiqa Elfadil (Widow)
For the Family

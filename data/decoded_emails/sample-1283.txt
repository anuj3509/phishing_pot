Attention Dear,

My name is Susan Wagner. I am a 61 year old US citizen, I live in Mount Kisco, New York. My Address is 365 Sarles St, Mt Kisco, NY 10549, USA. I'm thinking of moving because now I'm a wealthy woman, I was one of the scam victims who participated in the Compensation Awards Program in the United States and Europe many years ago and they refused to pay me. I paid over $27,500 to a scammer while in the US. to buy it all for the benefit so I decided to travel to Stockholm, Sweden with all the compensation documents and I was told to contact Barrister Jan Jensen, a member of the Compensation Awards Program, I contacted him through Email and he explained every detail to me. He said whoever contacted me now is a fake Pretend, he's the only one assigned to compensate me.

He took me to the bank to claim my compensation money. Right now I am the happiest woman in the world because I have received $5,500,000.00 in compensation (Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars). In addition, Barrister Jan Jensen shows all the information and a list of those who have not been paid and I saw your name and email address as one of the benefactors. This is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those scammers. They don't have your money. They are just extorting money from you by trickery. I would advise you to contact Barrister Jan Jensen now for assistance. You must contact him directly through the personal email address below.

Attorney: Jan Jensen
Email Address: jj7291634@gmail.com (mailto:jj7291634@gmail.com)

You must stop dealing with scammers who contact you by email and phone saying that your money is with them. It's all lies and tricks that they only take advantage of you and they will continue to steal your money until you have nothing to show.

The only money I paid after meeting Barrister Jan Jensen is €250. This is for working paperwork only please note that stop contacting scammers online or via email again. I suggest you contact Barrister Jan Jensen, he will help you transfer the winnings $5,500,000.00 in compensation (Five Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) to your bank account. Please stop dealing with those scammers all they do is ask for more and more money to complete your transaction which are all deceitful lies

Best Regards
Mrs Susan Wagner

Hello My Dearest,

I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must apologize for bringing this message to your email without any formal introduction due to the urgency of this issue. I am happy to know you but the Almighty Allah knows you better and knows why he directed me to you at this point. To begin I saw your email and contact details on my search for a good Next of kin online as a result of my urgency to put my last wish into reality before i die any time soon.

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Feyza Olcay Ýbrahim, I am contacting you from my country Turkey I want to tell you this because I don't have any other option than to tell you as I was touched to open up to you, I am married to Mr.Yusuf Ýbrahim who worked with Turkish Consulate General in Toronto Canada for Eight years before he died of the Turkey earthquake blast that took the live of 50,783 people On February. We were married for eleven years without a child.

He died after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit turkey. He was a victim of a collapse building and couldn't survive..  When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of €10,850,000.00 ( Ten million eight hundred and fifty thousand euro ) in a bank here in Turkey. Presently this money is still in the bank, he made this money available for importation of Gold from Papua, indonesia mining before his sudden death. Recently My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of 3 months due to cancer problems again. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke illness.  Having known my condition, I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.

I want you to take 60 Percent of the total money for your personal use and for your effort and dedication towards the charity project work,  while 40% of the money will go to the charity project work, people in need from the street and helping the orphanage too, I grew up as an orphan and i don't have anybody as my family member. Also make sure that the house of Allah, Mosque is maintained from the funds. Am doing this so that Almighty Allah will forgive my sins and accept my soul because I have suffered from this illness so much. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact of the bank here in Turkey and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of the money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply,  then i will proceed with you to the bank for the money transfer to your bank account as soon as possible, that is if you are serious enough to handle the project and also dedicate your effort to it because i believe i can trust you honestly.

Yours faithfully.
Mrs.Feyza Olcay Ýbrahim

Hello,

Bitcoin Core 30.0 is here. A new chapter in how Bitcoin can be used, secured, and trusted.

This release introduces a browser-based wallet extension designed to make self-custody and node operation more accessible than ever. With a streamlined setup, lightweight architecture, and familiar interface, you can now:

          - Send, receive, and monitor Bitcoin securely

          - Validate transactions on your own terms

          - Operate in pruned mode (50–60GB), without full blockchain size

          - Access features like CoinJoin, Taproot, and Lightning compatibility

          - Stay connected to the Bitcoin network, without relying on third parties


Bitcoin Core 30.0 was built with the same principles that launched Bitcoin. Privacy, Autonomy, and Transparency, but updated for today’s users.

Whether you're new to Bitcoin or a longtime node runner, this version bridges power and simplicity.

No centralized custody. No compromises. Just Bitcoin, done right.

Warm regards,
The Bitcoin Core Team

Dear Sir

I am contacting you following my desire to go into an investment transaction with you, my name is Adams T. Harrison . I am a close confidant to some military personnel from a neighboring country who deserted the Army following a political problem in their Country and have been seeking refuge here in Ghana.

These my contacts are in possession of some huge amounts of funds well over 200 Million USD which they are desirous of moving and investing outside Africa under your care and management if you can help identify some viable investment portfolios.

As a close contact they confided in me seeking assistance to look for someone they can entrust the funds to, for management outside the African continent where political and economic conditions are stable.

Kindly contact me should this be of interest to you for more details, so together we can rub minds to achieve their desired goals.

I look forward to a positive response from you

Yours Truly

Adams T. Harrison

How are you today? Please can you confirm this to us before we make a
mistake, somebody called me today with this number 706-925-7615 saying
that he is your brother, he said that you died since 3 days ago and
before this happened you asked him to receive the funds on your
behalf. He forwarded his address for us to send the fund direct to
him;

1121 Odena RD S Sylacauga, AL - Alabama 35150
PH: 706-925-7615

But we are not sure about this. So that is why I am writing to know if
this is true or not. Please this fund is not something we could just
make any silly mistake or sending it to the wrong person because the
money is huge amount of money $7.5million usd. So this man is getting
us confused on what he is saying about your death.

I am sending this mail to you to find out the truth before I make any
mistake. I told the man to give me 2days to think about it. The man
said that his name is Mr. Keith he is from Alabama. So am sending
this message to confirm the truth but if I don't hear from anyone in
the next 2days I will hand over everything to him.

You are advice to reconfirm the following info;

1. FULL NAME:................................?
2. FULL CONTACT ADDRESS:..............?
3. TELEPHONE NUMBER OR WHATSAPP NUMBER:.............?
4. ANY OF YOUR IDENTIFICATION CARD........?

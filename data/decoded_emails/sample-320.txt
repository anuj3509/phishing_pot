Subject: I am contacting you for the second time.
To:





Greeting,

I am General Adam Nelson, one of the Commanding generals in the U.S Army
and presently serving in Syria.

Please I urgently need you to help me safeguard an amount of money I have
here in my possession which is worth the sum of Nineteen million US
Dollars ($19 Million).

I came across this mega cash during an operation. You may have heard about
one of the heaviest attack we had that nuetralized hundreds of ISIS
terrorists in the past few months and it was during this operation that we
discovered this huge amount which we later distributed among the top
officers present during the operations. Considering how horrible and risky
it is here in this military camp, I deemed it necessary to look out for a
trusted fellow who would assist me in safeguarding the cash until I get
out of this horrible zone. It was to this effect that I started searching
online for an honest person whom I can trust to help me safeguard the cash
and I came across your mail address and I want to know if you are willing
to help me do this.

I want you to know that I am willing to offer you 35%-Percent of the total
amount if you do help me safeguard this money and get it out of here, I
will email you the details on how I plan on moving the cash out of this
place as soon as I receive your response.

Please get back to me ASAP

Thank you
Gen. Adam Nelson

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE JANET M DIFlORE FEDERAL BUILDINGS AD U.S
COURTHOUSE
Address: 255 W Main St #230, Charlottesville, VA 22902, USA

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR TRANSACTION,

I 'M CONTACTING YOU NOW BASE ON ISSUE ON MY DESK THIS MORNING BECAUSE
YOUR PAYMENT FILE WHICH CONTAIN YOUR $4.5M WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY MR
JEROME POWELL OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WHO ORDERED ME TO SIGN THE
CANCELLATION OF YOUR PAYMENT FILE AND I ASKED HIM WHY AND HE SAID THAT
YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED AND
YOU HAVE INSULTED HIM SO MUCH JUST BECAUSE THAT THEY TOLD YOU TO PAY
$250 TO COMPLETE YOUR FUND TRANSACTION.

SO I DECIDED TO WRITE YOU BECAUSE I FOLLOWED THE LAW AND I WILL NOT BE
AGAINST ANYBODY IN THIS WORLD AND I THINK THAT MAYBE HE HAS A LITTLE
PROBLEM
WITH YOU. I HAVE NOT TOUCH YOUR PAYMENT FILE UNTIL I HEAR FROM YOU
THIS MORNING BECAUSE I HAVE A HUMAN SYMPATHY AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL
NOT AFFORD TO LOSE YOUR FUND JUST BECAUSE OF $250 AND PLEASE ALL I
NEED FROM YOU IS SINCERITY AND TRUTH.

SO MY DEAR I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND IF YOU STILL NEED TO
RECEIVE YOUR FUND THEN I WILL TELL YOU WHERE YOU WILL SEND THE $250
AND HAVE THIS
FUND SEND TO YOU THROUGH MY POWER AND NOTHING WILL STOP IT.


YOUR URGENT REPLY IS NEEDED AS I AWAIT YOUR EMAIL NOW.

THANK YOU,
JUSTICE JANET M DIFIORE

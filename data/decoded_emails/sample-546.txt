Hey pentesters, In my last email, I shared a detailed video on &quot;TOP 10 Ways To Monetize Your Ethical Hacking Skills&quot;. And at the end of that email, I asked people to reply with YES if they wanted an announcement video about my upcoming course &quot;Web Hacking 360°&quot; and I literally got MULTIPLE HUNDRED replies below that video. So, I knew it was the VERY RIGHT time to make an announcement now. I'm excited to announce that I'm in the process of creating a new course called Web Hacking 360 ° . This will be the world's most advanced, most complete, most beginner-friendly, and the most practical course on web hacking ever created , and I can't wait to share it with you. In this upcoming course, you'll learn how to break the web and uncover its secrets with confidence . Whether you're a beginner or an experienced penetration tester, Web Hacking 360° has something for everyone to take your penetration testing skills to the next level. (Click the image or go to link: https://youtu.be/Sg-y3dr6sZc ) To learn more about Web Hacking 360, I want you to check out my announcement video on YouTube (same link above) . It will also show you a way you can get weekly updates about the course release date, behind-the-scenes, and more if you are interested. I'm still in the process of creating the course , but I wanted to give you a sneak peek at what's to come. Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to having you join me on this exciting journey. Reply back with YES &nbsp;if you would&nbsp; now&nbsp; like me to make a detailed podcast about How I would learn pentesting from scratch (if I could start over). Kind regards, Avinash Yadav ComproAvi School This mail was sent to phishing@pot | Unsubscribe

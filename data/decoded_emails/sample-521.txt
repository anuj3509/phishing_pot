Hey pentesters, Thanks for signing up for my Offensive Hacking Unfolded course on my website. In the upcoming days, I’ll be sending you some really useful resources, tips and lessons which I wish I knew when I started my career as a penetration tester. At least, I would have not wasted 4 initial years of my career then. But anyways, this is the very first email of that series and well, here you go… What happens is that most people don’t really think much about making money in the beginning , they just keep learning random stuff forever but only after it’s too late, they realise they never knew how the hell do I ethically make money with my hacking skills? SO, HERE ARE THE 10 MOST INCREDIBLE WAYS TO EARN MONEY AS AN ETHICAL HACKER! Offer vulnerability assessment services Offer penetration testing services including technical security tests, physical security tests and social engineering tests to test their employee awareness Offer security auditing services or compliance auditing services Provide red teaming services to organisations to simulate real-world attacks Teach paid recorded-courses or conduct LIVE classes about ethical hacking Write a book or ebook related to ethical hacking and sell it Create and sell custom ethical hacking exploit kits or tools (e.g., burp suite) Create and sell ethical hacking hardware products (e.g., rubber ducky) Provide security consulting services Provide security awareness training for employees of organisations Note: Companies can even hire you as a permanent employee for some of these jobs. And of course... how can we forget about the infamous, the incredible, the biggest, the oldest, and the no-entry barrier method: Bug Bounty Hunting . Reply back with YES if you would like me to make a “detailed” youtube video on this topic. Or, do you have any other suggestions? p.s. I am also working on a new course called “Web Hacking 360°” which is going to be the world’s most advanced and job-ready web pentesting and bug hunting course ever. More details on this soon &gt;3 Kind Regards, Avinash Yadav ComproAvi School This mail was sent to phishing@pot | Unsubscribe

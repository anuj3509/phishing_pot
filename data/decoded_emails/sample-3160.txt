Untitled Document Do you know what part of your face INSTANTLY gives away your age to a stranger? Is it your eyes��� the wrinkles on your forehead��� or how about the lines around your mouth? Believe it or not, it's your neck! However, earlier this year, Dr. Layke revealed there is a simple and effective way to help take years off your neck's appearance, in as little as 30 seconds. According to renowned plastic surgeon Dr. John Layke, when someone looks at you, over half of the surface area they see is actually your neck ��� meaning your neck is even MORE noticeable than your face! Says Dr. Layke: "That's why if you have sagging jowls, "turkey neck," "necklace lines," or a droopy double chin,�� you may appear up to 15-20 years OLDER than you really are. " Worst of all, he reveals that traditional moisturizers do almost NOTHING to address the unique skin of the neck. However, earlier this year, Dr. Layke revealed there��is��a simple and effective way to help�� take years off your neck's appearance,��in as little as 30 seconds. "Up until now, this "look younger" secret was something only my celebrity clients were privy to��� But it's actually so simple,�� you can do it yourself ��� right at home." This surprising do-it-yourself technique was developed by Dr. Layke himself last year in Beverly Hills, California, to help actresses look sleek and flawless on film and the red carpet. And due to its shocking success, he is now sharing it publicly in�� this FREE step-by-step video , so anyone can begin using it to achieve a younger and fresher look ��� by��dramatically tightening the appearance of aging neck skin. Anyone can begin using it to achieve a younger and fresher look ��� by dramatically tightening the appearance of aging neck skin.

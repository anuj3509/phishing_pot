 Bisq Desktop Application

Our native desktop client has been completely refreshed, and it now supports all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Key improvements in this release include:

Enhanced performance for faster trade processing and network connections.

Stronger security with updated protocols and improved escrow handling.

Improved stability to ensure uninterrupted trading sessions.

Cross-platform support with optimized builds for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Why use the desktop app?
The Bisq desktop application gives you the full power of non-custodial, peer-to-peer trading directly on your own machine. By keeping your keys in your hands at all times, you stay in full control of your funds—without relying on central servers or exposing your identity to third parties.

Chromium-Based Extension

To complement the desktop experience, our new Chromium extension helps streamline how you interact with your Bisq client.

Key features include:

Quick access to your Bisq account activity from within your browser.

Real-time trade notifications to stay updated while browsing.

Seamless integration with the Bisq desktop client for a unified workflow.

The Bottom Line

This release represents an important step forward in making Bisq more secure, more convenient, and more accessible across all platforms. Whether you’re running Linux, Windows, or macOS, you can now enjoy a refined desktop experience supported by a lightweight browser extension that keeps you connected at all times.

We encourage you to update today and take advantage of these improvements.

Thank you for continuing to build and trade with Bisq.

Warm regards,
The Bisq Team

This is a Bequest notice.

I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have
never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to
choose you amongst the numerous internet users in the world, precisely
I cannot say why I have chosen you but do not be worried for I saw
your profile on the Internet, which has made me accomplish my request.
May the almighty God bless and see you through with this mission if
you can carefully read and digest the message below.

Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography,
I am Mother Mary Louis, 67 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir
Jean Louis who died alongside our only child in a Plane crash on
Monday the 7th of September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying
from New York to Geneva. Please see the site below for more
information.

After the death of my husband and son ,I became the Head of his
investment and just recently, the doctors handling my health issues at
Cancer center: Christie Hospital NHS Trust UK, have said I may not
live beyond the next two months after my next surgery,but before the
death of my husband we had a plan to use the last days of our lives to
donate half of what we have worked for to the less privilege and
charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family members and
close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not alive
today to do this with me and I am very weak with cancer and coupled
with the recent announcement from the doctor, hence I have decided to
do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I.

Presently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several
charity homes and to some of the less privileged in different
countries. Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give
aid to the deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual
we have not met before in life due to the fact when we were still
young in life we received an anonymous help from an individual we did
not know and which we have not been able to know till date, the impact
we got from such gesture made us to do same.

I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know
me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I
have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the
beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial
status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer.

I have presently instructed my bank manager to assist any person I
will introduce to him as the beneficiary to the last will in the sum
of Ten Million  United State Dollars (10,000,000.00) with my bank in
Nigeria the FIRST INLAND BANK NIGERIA PLC. I decided to do this now
unconditionally knowing that my days are numbered.

To conclude with this bequest, please provide me with your Data to
fully which I will use to write a Letter of Authorization on your
behalf and send it to the bank as my new Next of Kin.


Full Names:
Physical address;
Direct telephone number
Occupation

Note: Please I do not want you to thank me, same gesture was shown to
us, all I need you to do is, When you get this fund, use %15 for
yourself and the rest to assist the less privileged in your community
and country,this is the only way to immortalize us when I am gone.

Yours Faithfully

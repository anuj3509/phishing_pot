Pardot users often find that they need a more scalable solution as their business grows, and as a result, weâ€™ve seen many customers switch to Marketo in recent months. These customers see immediate increases of 30-100% in productivity and a dramatic increase in leads â€“ purely because they get much more capability in an easier-to-use package. ,

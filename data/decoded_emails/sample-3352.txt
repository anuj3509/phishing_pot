Hello,

I hope this message finds you in good health and spirits. My name is Sally Burton, and I am a philanthropist who has dedicated my life to helping those in need around the world. I am 76 years of age, and about a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. Despite all efforts to fight and resist it, I have been unable to overcome this illness, and I have come to terms with the fact that my time on this earth is limited.

As I reflect on my life and my legacy, I have decided to bequeath part of my fortune (Â£1,963,920.00 GBP) to individuals who share my passion for helping those in need. I have chosen you as one of the beneficiaries of this donation because I believe that you have the potential to make a positive impact in your immediate environment, particularly during these challenging times.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic crisis have had a devastating impact on many communities around the world. As a result, I am directing this donation towards individuals who are inclined to help those who have been most affected by these crises. I hope that you will use these funds to support both your personal goals and charitable causes that are aligned with my vision of uplifting the downcast.

Please note that this is a charity donation, and I expect that you will use the funds in good faith to help those in need in your immediate environment. I will not be monitoring or directing how you use these funds, but I trust that you will act with integrity and sincerity.

If you are interested in accepting this donation, please reply directly to this message, for more information. I will provide you with the necessary details and instructions to access the funds. If you find this message in your junk folder, please move it to your inbox so that you can reply to me directly. 

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best Regards,
Sally Burton

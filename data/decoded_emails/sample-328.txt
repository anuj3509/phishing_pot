Assunto: Your Urgent Notice

Greet to you,

I am Nigel Prideaux - Director of Communications & Corporate Affairs NatWest Bank. I would respectfully request that you keep the content of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come across as a result of this mail. I contacted you privately and no one is informed of this communication. I will give you the entire story behind the Business here. I do hope you find it interesting enough in accepting this proposal.

Sometime in 2010, a certain Engineer/contractor Late made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, currently valued at GBP4,843,000.00(Four Million Eight Hundred and Forty-Three Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling) in my bank. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his forwarding address but we got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder, and finally, we discovered from his contract employers, Royal Dutch plc that the deceased depositor had died alongside his longtime companion in an Auto crash. If you are familiar with private banking practice, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In the deceased bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, accounts are rarely held under a name, depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.

In this case, the deceased Client died intestate. In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away my bank conducted a search in good faith to determine who should have the right to claim the funds. This has for the past years been unfruitful. This sum has since been sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one has been able to come forward for it. According to the Laws of my environment (United Kingdom), at the expiration of a given period if the said fund is not claimed the money will revert to the ownership of the United Kingdom government.

The banking world is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. In this case, I alone have the deposit details as I was the account officer to the deceased at the time the account Fixed deposit was made. My bank will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of relationship with the deceased is presented. The bank's management has no single idea of the history of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to the party that comes forward. This is the situation. My bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family.

Consequently, what I propose is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to the depositor as you both have the same last name so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response. Being aware of this request I am making, I ask that if you find no interest in this project you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find it against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictate that I make this move. Such opportunities only come one's way once in a lifetime.

The reward for this project makes it a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting the public. My position guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you find yourself able to work with me, I urge you to indicate to that effect

Awaiting your urgent reply

With Regards,
Nigel Prideaux
Director of Communications
Corporate Affairs
NatWest Bank

Dear beloved one,

Greetings, to you. I have come across your name and contact as I search the
mail for a very good partner.

Briefly I will explain a business to you and if it would be to your
interest, then we can move ahead to effectively build this business
relationship.

I have inherited the sum of 250 million dollars from my late father. The
funds had been with a bank here in my country.

As a result of some agreement clause, they could not release the funds to
me here locally.

On one occasion I went to the bank, a director of the bank called me and
explained to me that even if I want to transfer the funds out to the
account of a foreign partner, that it would take a lot of time, lawyers and
many expenses. He explained to me that the rigors are so much and most
foreign partners might not be interested to involve in such expenditures
because of the fear of scam.

He advised me that, If I can get a foreign partner but instead of
transferring the funds to the account of the foreign partner, the bank will
offer an ATM card to my partner.

The ATM card is a PREMIUM PLATINUM CARD and this would allow us to make
withdrawals of the fund in your country to the tune of 50,000-100,000
dollars per day.

He explained to me that the card is good and would be sent to the contact
of my foreign partner by DHL or FEDEX.

If you are interested to partner with me, please reach back to me through
for details and we can also discuss my investment plans.

Kind Regards,
Kenny Adams

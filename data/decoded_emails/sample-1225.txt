Assunto: Good Day , ----------From United Nation Economic (UN).

Good Day  ,

I am Ambassador Collen Vixen Kelapile President of the United Nation Economic and Social Council and I work hand to hand with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the bureau of unclaimed funds and the World Bank ,

We discovered that you have an unclaimed payment that was supposed to be remitted to you, maybe due to some unforeseen circumstance that allow you to finish your transactions home or abroad, so I took it upon myself to get in touch with you before it will be forfeited as you still have the chance to claim your funds. Get back to me for more details on how to claim your payment before it is marked unclaimed.

I need your full name, current Phone number, Home address and a copy of your valid Id card, so that we can commence the process of approving the funds to your name for possible transfer within 48 hours.

Stay Safe & Healthy.

Yours sincerely,
Ambassador Collen V. Kelapile (UN).

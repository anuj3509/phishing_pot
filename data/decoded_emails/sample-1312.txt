Dear Friend ,

Since i waited so long without hearing from you regarding your confirm
able draft worth of $7,500000,I went ahead and cashed the money and
registered it with Trans world courier service as box of African clothes
with instruction to deliver it to you upon your contact to their office,


i am leaving today to another country for three months course.You can
contact them now to avoid them delaying with the box. use below
reference number { 29377 }

Bear in mind that i have paid all the charges they requested,Both mailing
charges and insurance.All you need to do is to pay their security keeping
fee of $350 USD,I would have paid it before leaving but they insisted that
it will be paid by you since they don't know when you will be contacting
them.Below is their contact details remember that I registered it as
African clothes do not allow them know that it content its money if not
they may delay you more and charge you more know that the only money you
are supposed to pay them is the keeping fee of $350 USD:

Also ensure to reconfirm your full info to them to make sure you are the
real owner

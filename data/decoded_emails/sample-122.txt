Hello there,
 
My name is Patricia Vanpe , I got your contact via the web which culminated in my contacting you. I have an investor that want to invest large volume of funds into a company that needs fund for expansion only and not a start-up or new company. Healthy companies in any sector that needs funds for EXPANSION.
 If you recommend a Company to take loan or investment funds from my client the investor, me and you will be entitled to 5% of any amount received by the Company from the investor, but if you are taking the fund directly as a company i will be entitled to 2.5% and you will retain 2.5% as Global Finder's fee commission.
 
There will be a face-to-face meeting between the investor and the investee for signing of contract agreement and fund disbursement .What .I will initially need is the company profile and the project summary of the company that need funding to present to my investor.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 Patricia Vanpe.

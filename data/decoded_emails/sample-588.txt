Dear Friend,

I got your contact email address on the internet in my search for a reputable, reliable, and trustworthy person who can stand confidently with me in this business proposal that would be of great benefit and a life changing opportunity. Before I proceed, I would like to introduce myself to you. My name is HOWARD JONES, I am the Senior Contract Manager of the Contract Award Section of HB Tunnelling Construction Limited here in the United Kingdom. We recently awarded a contract and I intentionally over-invoiced the contract with the excess amount of Ј4 million pounds with the view that as soon as the real contractors receive their full contract payment of Ј10 million pounds, then I will claim the excess balance of Ј4 million pounds for my personal use.

This sum of Ј4 million pounds originated from a deliberated over-invoiced Contract Payment Voucher of a total value of Ј14 million pounds contract awarded to Foreign Contractors for the supply and installation of PIPELINE EQUIPMENT to an Oil & Gas Refinery. The contract was carried out successfully and all the equipment has been completely supplied since last month on Friday the 17th day of April, 2023.

The American and Chinese Company who supplied the equipment was paid accordingly the real contract sum of Ј10 million pounds immediately after the completion of the contract. It is therefore due for me to claim this balance sum of Ј4 million pounds as final phase payment to a foreign contractor, but I cannot accomplish this without collaborating with a foreign partner or firm into whose Bank account this over invoiced sum of ?4 million pounds will be transferred to as the beneficiary of the fund.
Moreover, as a civil servant, I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts.

Now, I am looking for a trustworthy person who I can refer and present to the Bank to claim the excess fund of Ј4 million pounds presently in the HB Tunnelling Limited Contract Reserve Account in National Westminster Bank Plc. I, being the Senior Contract Manager of the Contract Awarding Committee of the HB Tunnelling Limited, I am the only person in position to appoint to National Westminster Bank Plc to release the over invoiced sum of ?4 million pounds to any foreign beneficiary's Bank account that would be referred to National Westminster Bank Plc by me.
It is in light of this development that I need your participation, assistance, and co-operation to present and refer you to the Transfer Department of Bank Of America Plc to claim the excess amount of Ј4 million pounds as the last contractor that has completed the supply of the final equipment.
For your understanding, I have made all necessary arrangements for the smooth transfer of the Ј4 million pounds into your bank account on legal grounds in such a way that there is no risk to partners on either side. The only risk I foresee here is your alerting my company or your refusal to work with me.
Contact me on my direct email address for further clarification and transparency

I look forward to your quick response.

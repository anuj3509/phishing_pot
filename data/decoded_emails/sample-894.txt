I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Fifteen Million and Seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($15.7M USD) but I did not hear from you since that time, Then I went and credit it into ATM Visa Card and i have deposited the ATM card with Eagle Express Courier Service Company Washington, DC, United States before I traveled out of the state for a short business project and I will not be back till next year. What you have to do now is to contact the Eagle Express Courier Service Company Washington, DC, United States as soon as possible to know when they will deliver your package to you because of the ATM Card expiring date.

For your information I have paid for the delivery Charges, and Insurance fee. The only money you will send to the Eagle Express Courier Service Company for delivery of your package direct to your postal Address is $50 only, being the Security Keeping Fee of the Courier Company so far. Again, don’t be deceive by anybody to pay any other money except $50, I would have paid that, but they said no because they don’t know when you will contact them and in case of demurrage. You have to contact the Eagle Express Courier Service Company now for the delivery of your ATM card package with this information below.

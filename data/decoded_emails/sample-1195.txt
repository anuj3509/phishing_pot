Dearest, Greetings and blessings of the day to you. Thanks so much for your urgent reply and I want you to know that it takes me time to write you an email because I was thinking who I will trust, like I asked you in my previous email, if I can trust you?. But as I got your reply to my proposal letter I sent to you I was happy and I know we have not met before nor do we know each other before. The one word my late father always told me when he was alive, that before I move on in life, I should know how to trust and also be careful of people I meet on my way. Once again my name is Miss. Jane Konan, I am 19 years old. I am a citizen of Sierra Leone, but I am staying in Ivory Coast as a refugee now due to my present condition. I have finished secondary school and left to enter university. Please as I told you I need your help and assistance to secure my inheritance funds and invest it in a profitable business. The funds my late father kept in the bank here on my name before he died. The total amount of the money is (US$16,750.000.00) and the money is in a bank here in Abidjan. And this fund is 100% genuine, clean and risk free. My father was a very rich cocoa farmer and he dealt with other minerals like gold, crude oil and diamond. He&#39;s a very hard working man but he was poisoned to death by his evil relatives because of the big contract he won. While he was dying in the hospital, he told me everything and advised me to run out of Sierra Leone and seek a foreigner overseas who can help me, before his evil relatives would get me and kill me too. This is how I ran down to Abidjan here, where I am presently staying in a refugee camp. I want you to stand as my guardian before the bank and receive the money in your account and invest it in a profitable business on my behalf in your country, at my age I cannot handle such matters and I do not want to risk my life, because this place is full of desperate people. I went to the bank here with the deposit document the bank had with my father and they confirmed it was clean and OK. And they are ready to transfer the money through bank to bank wire transfer as soon as you stand as my guardian. Please, I would like you to reply to me so that I will give you all the information about the bank, so that you can contact them. And after that you will arrange for me to come over to your country and start a new life and continue my education. Note: Please permit me to ask these few questions: 1. Can you really help me invest this money into a profitable business in your country? 2. Can you honestly help me as your daughter and keep this trust? 3. What percentage will be good for you after you have helped to transfer this money to your country? 4. If you agree to help me please send me your full details. I have the original copies of deposit documents in my possession and I am ready to send it to you immediately, I confirm your sincerity to assist me. I am waiting for your kind reply. You&#39;re faithful. Miss. Jane Konan

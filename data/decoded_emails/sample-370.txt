Assunto: ON MY DYING BED (Please Read)


May the peace of God be with you and your family. I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider this a divine intervention as a pastor explained to me. I have emailed several letters to you in the past but they all came back to me as undelivered messages. I hope you'll receive my email this time because this might just be my last email to you. I feel like someone's been sabotaging my emails and preventing them from reaching your email address.

My name is Mrs. Floria Morton, a widow from Oklahoma, USA and I am writing to you from my sick bed because I have been fighting cancer and the doctors say I have only a few weeks left. I want to entrust my money ($8.5 million USD) to your care for charity purposes to help the less privileged as my late husband's relatives want me dead so that they will claim all my late husband and I worked for. I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once you receive it. Please write to me soon as my health is pretty bad and my doctor says I will be moved to the intensive care unit anytime soon. Have a blessed day and please do pray for me. God bless you.


Yours Mrs. Floria Morton

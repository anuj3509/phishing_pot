Best Wishes to you and please note that this message may be delivered to JUNK EMAIL FOLDER OR SPAM due to the configuration!!!

We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to benefit from Afro-Euro-Asia Global Economic Meltdown Relief Program which is a beneficiary of Afro-Euro-Asia Diplomatic & Humanitarian Organisation Ltd. Your email address was registered for this program and you have been shortlisted as a beneficiary.

Afro-Euro-Asia Diplomatic & Humanitarian Organisation Ltd is a dissolved company incorporated on 17 March 2010 with the registered office located in West Midlands. The liquid asset of the company presently stands at £210,886.000.00GBP (Two Hundred and Ten Million Eight Hundred and Eighty-Six Thousand British Pounds Sterling). This fund has been lying in a dormant account all these years and would have been forfeited to the British Government (The Crown) before the directors took a decision to give back to the society since the company which is a non profit organisation has been dissolved.

You are among those selected through a random computer ballot system and therefore this serves as a notice of approval to claim a grant of One Million British Pounds credited to reference above.
 
For the full details of how to successfully receive your grant, you are advised to immediately contact our payment processing centre in the United Kingdom to receive guidance on the claims procedure. Please be notified that you are not required to make any payment to this office but you are under obligation to donate 30% of this grant to charity and it will strictly be supervised accordingly. You may also be asked to present some documents and in some circumstances our agents might decide to pay you a visit through our embassy in your country of origin to authenticate your claims. 

Our office will immediately commence the claims process to facilitate the release of your grant as soon as you make contact with them. Your claim becomes invalid after 14 working days and you will be replaced by other participants.

Contact the payment processing officer:
Name: Ahmed Shoukath Ali
Email: paymentprocessingcentre@gmail.com
       ahmedshoukathali787@gmail.com

For security reasons and purpose of confidentiality your name will not be published in the media and you are also advised to keep this notification from public notice until you receive your benefit as this is part of our precautionary measures to avoid double claims or abuse of this program. Also any display of dishonesty will result in automatic disqualification.

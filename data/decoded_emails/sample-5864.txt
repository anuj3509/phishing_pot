Dear Midnight Community,

As part of the ongoing Glacier Drop Airdrop, we want to provide an important update on wallet compatibility for claiming your NIGHT tokens.

Yoroi Wallet has released significant improvements to their wallet extensions. These updates are designed to better facilitate a seamless and secure claiming process for all eligible users across the supported blockchains.

Update on Hardware Devices
We are aware of a complexity issue affecting the use of hardware devices (Ledger, Trezor, etc.) in the claiming process across multiple networks. Please rest assured that this has no impact on your allocation. Your claim remains fixed and will be fully available once the issue is resolved.

In the meantime, we are endorsing the Yoroi Wallet Extension as the only supported extensions for claiming:

Cardano (ADA) and supported chains: Please use the Yoroi Wallet Extension. Download or update to the latest version here â†’ [ttps://download.yoroiextensionwallet.com

Installing the latest versions ensures you benefit from the improved security and optimized flow for claiming your allocation. This is especially important for users managing their NIGHT tokens alongside existing ADA, XRP, and hardware wallet setups.

Your allocations are secured, your NIGHT tokens are waiting, and your participation is central to the growth of the Midnight network. We are committed to making this process as smooth as possible and will continue providing updates as we work to resolve the hardware device compatibility issue.

Thank you for being part of this historic launch of Midnight. Together, we are building a privacy-first blockchain that empowers individuals and communities around the world.

Sincerely,
The Midnight Foundation Team

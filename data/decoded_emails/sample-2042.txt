 Hi dhg,
My name's Dylan Basile and I work at Event Temple. Nice to meet you
and
thanks for requesting a demo.
Joining me for a quick demo will be the fastest and most efficient way
for
you to see what the software is capable of.
Did any of the times on our website work for you and if so, were you
able
to schedule a demo okay?
Here they are again: https://calendly.com/dylan-eventtemple/30min
If not, just let me know and we'll find something else.

More than a quarter of Europeans surveyed believe Jews have too much
influence in business and finance. One in five say they have too much
influence in media and politics. In individual countries the numbers
are often higher: 42% of Hungarians think Jews have too much influence

It's a 17-year-old boy, too frightened to wear a kippa (a religious
skullcap) on the streets of Paris. It's an Israeli restaurant owner in
Berlin who is told that he will end up in the gas chambers. It's a
24-year-old Austrian who knows nothing about the Holocaust. It's the
armed guards outside synagogues and Jewish schools across much of
Europe. It's the online chat rooms where people peddle conspiracy
theories that Jewish "globalists" run the world.
It can be violent or subtle. Overt or insidious. Political or
personal. It can come from the right or the left. It exists in
countries that have large Jewish populations, like France, and it also
flourishes in places with smaller Jewish communities, like Poland

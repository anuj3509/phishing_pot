Managing Director/CEO of this bank is now on compulsory leave and all
power have been vested on me to make all international
payments.Also,due to reported cases of corrupt practices in other
Nigeria Banks including the Central Bank of Nigeria,the Federal
Government has revoked/canceled all power vested on those banks and
has appointed our bank (First Bank of Nigeria) to make all foreign
payments.Be informed that the Federal Government have approved the
release of part-payment of$7.5M(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars) out of your total funds,which has been in this bank for many
years unclaimed because Mr.Jacobs Ajekigbe,Collaborated with the
Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)and have refused to tell you
the truth on how to claim your fund this is because he has been using
the interest accumulated .

within 5 hours the same day.It will Cost you little money for the
Transfer (COT) and no stoppage from any Government departments as the
transfer will be done within the bank alone and it is very safe.The
method which was introduced to you before is the Telegraphic Transfer
(TT) for which confirmation was 48hrs,because of the time
factor,petitions could come from various organizations stopping your
payment and asking you to pay huge fee which would be difficult for
you to pay so that they can benefit from the huge interest your fund
generates while still in the Bank.

This method is not safe for you because it is not done within the bank
alone as information of the payment would be sent to the Central
Control Unit (CCU) of the Federal Ministry of Finance and office of
the Accountant General of the Federation.As a good Christian, I have
nothing to gain by keeping your fund,I want to assist you receive your

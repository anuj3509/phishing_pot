Due to my deteriorating health condition which most doctors have confirmed
I will not survive no matter what. I have decided to willingly Donate the
sum of USD$5,600,000:00 (Five Million, Six hundred thousand Dollars) to
charity and individuals through you for the good work of the lord, and to
help the motherless, less privileged and also for the assistance of the
widows.I am therefore reaching out to you, soliciting that you accept this
donation from me on behalf of the less privileged ones in our society and
use the money to set up a charity organization and to take care of the
abandoned widows who need help for survival. This appeal is meant for one
with a deep sense of responsibility and commitment to serving humanity.*

intended purposes, Please get back to me at my email address at

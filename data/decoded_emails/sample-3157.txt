It&rsquo;s becoming common for people over 40 to say they suddenly feel like they have the body of someone 20 years older. Telltale signs include gas, bloating, joint stiffness, daytime fatigue, and unwanted weight gain. &ldquo;Contrary to popular belief, these are not natural problems. Not at age 40, 50, or even 80. We think we&rsquo;ve discovered why it&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo;��says Dr. Steven Gundry ��� one of Castle Connolly&rsquo;s Top American Doctors. According to Dr. Gundry&rsquo;s research, there&rsquo;s one "anti-nutrient" that&rsquo;s become widespread in American food. And this unhealthy compound ��� rather than just "age" ��� is often behind the digestive, energy, and weight problems people are having. "Unfortunately, this compound is in nearly everything we eat at this point,"��Dr. Gundry continues.��"Since it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to avoid, we&rsquo;ve had to come up with a different solution." Fortunately, after working with thousands of patients, Dr. Gundry discovered there was one food that could actually block your body from absorbing the compound in the first place. He found, if you�� added this one food to your diet... ��you could start getting back your energy, relieving digestive issues... and even losing weight more easily. In fact, when Dr. Gundry had a pilot group of people try this, nearly all of them reported feeling a big difference by the first check-in a few weeks later.

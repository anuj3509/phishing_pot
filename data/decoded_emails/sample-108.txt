Dear Sir / Madam ;

I regret this informal way of contacting you, which I believe would be most effective concerning the information I intend to bring to your notice. Although we have never met before, I have every reason to think that you are a highly respected personality. I sourced your profile from a Human Resource Profile database in your home country.

I'm Williams Sankoh.The first son and heir to the late SIR AGOGOMAKA SANKOH, who was the famous Cocoa merchant in 
Cote d'Ivoire-Abidjan precisely with several affiliates all over the Western and European World.

Since his demise here in West Africa and Diaspora, I have been the sole Director of logistics under the partnership with a foreign expatriate who we lost mid-last Year (2021) due to the deadly COVID 19 Outbreak.

Therefore, I seek a reliable and trustworthy business partner for continuity and lifetime Investment Abroad.

Given this anticipated development, I have decided to search for a trustable businessman or woman to stand in as a MANAGER to secure our Funds in the sum of Six Million eight Hundred thousand United State Dollars ($6.8M) currently deposited by our generous late partner in Security Consignment Boxes which are in a Financial Trust Company located in the United States of America.

Immediately your Interest is confirmed, you shall be invited to Cote d'Ivoire-Abidjan (West Africa)for Us to further our discussions and clear the Security Boxes in the Custody of the Security Clearing Company as a "BENEFICIARY" for us to commence Investments.

All arrangements are in place to execute a successful partnership together. I must remind you of the confidentiality of this transaction at hand, whatever your decision.
   
While I await your Response, your detailed reply should contain your Telephone and Fax Numbers for more accessible communication. You should send all correspondence to this email.

Best Regard,
Williams Sankoh.

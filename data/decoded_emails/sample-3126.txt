Untitled Document Do you know that? Is it your eyes… the wrinkles on your forehead… or how about the lines around your mouth? Believe it or not, it's your neck! However, earlier this year, Dr. Layke revealed there is a simple and effective way to help take years off your neck's appearance, in as little as 30 seconds. According to renowned plastic surgeon Dr. John Layke, when someone looks at you, over half of the surface area they see is actually your neck — meaning your neck is even MORE noticeable than your face! Says Dr. Layke: &quot;That's why if you have sagging jowls, &quot;turkey neck,&quot; &quot;necklace lines,&quot; or a droopy double chin,&nbsp; you may appear up to 15-20 years OLDER than you really are. &quot; Worst of all, he reveals that traditional moisturizers do almost NOTHING to address the unique skin of the neck.

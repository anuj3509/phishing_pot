&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This message is safe Dear Friend, It might be a surprise to you reading from me again as I had written an earlier email to you but without a response. Presently, I'm in the hospital where I am undergoing treatment for Esophageal Cancer. Today my Doctor told me that I will not live up to two months. I am Mrs Latifah Yusuf, widow to late Ahmed Yusuf, former deputy defense attachпїЅ to Benin consulate in Czech Republic. My husband was killed by those who were envious of his position in the same office. There is 4.1 Million Dollars my late husband deposited in a bank here in Benin. But before his death he vowed to use his wealth for the orphanages. I have decided to donate this money to an individual, who will utilize it in fulfillment of the last request of my late husband and this is why I contacted you. Reply with your full names, phone number, address and occupation so that I will give you more details. Remain blessed. Yours Sincerely, Mrs Latifah Yusuf

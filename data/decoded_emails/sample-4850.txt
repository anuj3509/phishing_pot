My Dear Beloved Friend,

Greetings-compliment of the Season!!.



Greetings and thank you for your response. Please let this not sound
strange to you because I am not asking you for money, for my only surviving
lawyer who would have done this, died early this year. I prayed and got
your email address from your country's guest book which I got from my late
husband's archive and I wish to visit once more if God will in his infinite
mercies grant me In function of your good profile, I want to solicit your
assistance in the discharge of my Will.



I am Mrs. Lisa Collins, and am aged 68 years suffering from endometrial
cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a charitable project with the
money that I inherited from my deceased husband who died in a motor
accident.



I was brought up from a motherless baby's home and was married to my late
husband for twenty nine years without a child, my friends have plundered so
much of my wealth since my illness and I cannot live with the agony of
entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them anymore, so I sold all
my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of £9,000,000 GBP (Nine
Million Pounds) with my bank.



All I need is an honest person who will use at least %60 of the funds as I
would instruct, then the rest %40 will go to you for helping me accomplish
this mission because donating this money to charity is the only legacy I
can leave behind after my death, No money is required from you to carry on
with this project because it is my heart desire to make a generous gift to
you to work for a charity in your country.



I don't mind if you are a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist rather
my only paramount concern here is whether I can trust you because this
generation is filled up with greedy and fraudulent people all over the
world. I will give you more details as soon as I hear from you.



Looking forward to your urgent response on my below private email:
Lisacollinsfarms@outlook.com





Kind regards.

Mrs. Lisa Collins.
